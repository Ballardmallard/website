Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

Welcome to my website!\nI’m currently a fellow in the department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. I’m also in my first year of an NIH sponsored T32 grant and currently completing an MS in Biomedical Health Informatics (BHI) at Case Western Reserve University.\nClinically my interests are very broad, ranging from the micro (proteomics, transcriptomics) to the macro (health policy/econoimcs) and everything in between (organ based physiology, comparative physiology, heart-lung interaction, physics of ventilators, echocardiography in critical care).\nIn this website you’ll be able to see some of the projects I’m currently working on, non-clinical interets, curriculum vitae, and more!\nDon’t be a stranger!"

    "text": "A new paradigm in PH\nThe prior 5 group model of PH is out of date. It was a model of convenience that related different subset of diseases to the organ system that was thought to cause the primary insult leading to the subsequent development of PH. Yet we have know for some time that this is a grouping of convenience and not rooted in rigorous scientific understanding of the underlying disease process. Over the coming months we hope to role out a new PH grouping, one that is rooted in both physiologic but also transcriptomic data."
